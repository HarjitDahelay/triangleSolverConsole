This tutorial will show you how to build a nice "triangle calculator" 
that will calculate all the sides and angles in a right triangle 
provided that you give it atleast two angles and a side length,
or an angle and two side lengths. It does this using sin, cos, tan, the Pythagorean theorem, 
and the fact that all angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees.
